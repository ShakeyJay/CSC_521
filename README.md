# CSC_521

## To run a portfolio simulation:

```
conda create -n csc521 python=3.8
conda activate csc521
# I will set this up in a requirements file in the future.
conda install numpy, pandas # etc. I do not have them all listed yet
```

The following command will run using the main settings in the confs/test_base.json

```
python run.py
```

We will put in the ability to create your own confs in the future.
